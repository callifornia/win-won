  Different SQL Operators:::    = , <, >, >=, <=, <>, !=, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, IN, NOT IN, LIKE, ALIASE, DISTINCT, LIMIT, CASE:
  Comparison Operators: =, <>, != , >, <, >=, <=
  Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
  Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE etc.

  Constrains:
    - CHECK
    - NOT NULL,
    - UNIQUE
    - PRIMARY KEY     => on one or few columns
    - FOREIGN KEY

There are two way of writing select queries with a join:
They both are ok to use

    1. select t1.column, t2.column
       from table_one as t1
       join table_two as t2 on t1.id = t2.id

    2. select t1.column, t2.column
       from table_one as t1, table_two as t2
       where t1.id = t2.id
